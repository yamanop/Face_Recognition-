# Face_Recognition_System
This is a basic project using Python and OpenCV in which you can feed the data of the person in form of image and run the code. If the same person appears on the camera it shows up person's name present message and close on pressing (q)
If any unknown face comes which has no data then it will store its information as "unkown present"
All the data is written in csv files created with date and time as their name.
Date and Time will also be mentioned inside the csv file.
